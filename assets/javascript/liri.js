// * In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

    // * Name of the venue

    // * Venue location

function spotifyThisSong(songName) {
    //process.env.SPOTIFY_ID
//process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET
//     * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

//     * Artist(s)

//     * The song's name

//     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

//     * The album that the song is from

//   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

//   * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

//   * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:

//   * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>

//   * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

//   * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

//   * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).

function movieThis(movieName) {

//       * Year the movie came out.
//       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
//       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
//       * Country where the movie was produced.
//       * Language of the movie.
//       * Plot of the movie.
//       * Actors in the movie.
//     ```

//   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

//     * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>

//     * It's on Netflix!

//   * You'll use the `axios` package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. You may use `trilogy`.

    // * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
